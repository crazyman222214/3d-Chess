# 3D Chess

## How It Works

This is using JMonkeyEngine's rendering libraries to render a 3d version of the game we all know and love: __Chess__

* All of the Piece Models was created by Michael
* All of the Game Engine design/code was created by Chris
* The Logic for the underlying game was created by Chris & Michael
